# Documentation

This section summarizes the most commonly extended classes in xodex and how to use them in your project.

- Objects: `DrawableObject`, `LogicalObject`, `EventfulObject` and helpers (see `object.md`).
- Scenes: `BaseScene` and lifecycle methods (see `scene.md`).

Where possible the docs include short code examples and the expected inputs/outputs for each public method.
